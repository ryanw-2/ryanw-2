Welcome! Find my projects below.

Iâ€™m a Carnegie Mellon Computer Science and Architecture student passionate about building immersive, user-driven 3D experiences. 
My goal for the upcoming semester is to work on real application research involving design, computer vision, robotics, and machine learning!

## Creative Work

If you are curious of what a Computer Science X Architecture student does, check out some of the design and creative
work that I'm really excited about too. Throughout this process tools like `Photoshop` and `Illustrator` have been
critical in developing linework, renders, and client ready presentations!
